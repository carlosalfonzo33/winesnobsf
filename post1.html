            <p>Santa Clara is the most populous county in the Bay Area. Also known as Silicon Valley, it’s a hotbed for the world’s leading technology companies, including internet, computing and renewable energy. An area with rich soils and Mediterranean climate, Native Americans named it the “Valley of the Heart’s Delight.</p>

            <p>Better known as “Silicon Valley”, the Santa Clara Valley has a long history of wine-making dating back to the Spanish Missions. Today, a few persevering wineries carry on the tradition and take advantage of the southern valley’s soils and climate to grow bold, warm-climate varieties. </p>

            <p>The growth of the technology sector in the region saw the area christened as Silicon Valley, and older Almaden Valley vineyards were uprooted to make way for urban sprawl. Today the majority of the remaining vineyards are found between the Diablo Mountains in Contra Costa and the Santa Cruz Mountains south of San Jose near Morgan Hill and Gilroy, with some in the foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains near Saratoga. A collaboration between the cities of Gilroy, Morgan Hill, and Santa Clara County, along with the Wineries of Santa Clara Valley, formed the "Santa Clara Valley Wine Trail" to connect the many wineries and aid in agritourism.</p>

            <p>The Gilroy Garlic Festival is one of the largest food festivals in the United States, held annually in Gilroy, California on the last full weekend in July at Christmas Hill Park. The 40th Garlic Festival was held on July 27–29, 2018. </p>

            <p>The festival showcases some of the best wineries Santa Clara Valley wine trail has to offer. Team Wine Snob has been attending the festival since 2007, and each year we get to talk to wine vendors and get to taste the wines being showcased at the festival. We take note of each wine we taste going from stand to stand and at the end of the day we talk about which vineyard stood out and which wine we enjoyed drinking, it's really an event I look forward to every year!</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

            <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

            <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

            <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

            <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

            <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
