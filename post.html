            <p>One of the first stops we made in Applegate Valley was Troon Vineyards. This Vineyard is one of my favorites to visit in the Applegate Valley. The scenery and property is beautiful and the wine is amazing.  A big thank you to Miranda at Troon for being so helpful and amazing with introducing us to all the wines this vineyard has to offer.  I was instantly sold on becoming a member! </p>

            <span class="caption text-muted">Troon is a must visit when visting Applegate Valley wine country</span>

            <p>Our next stop on our tour of Applegate Valley was Schmidt Family Vineyards.</p>

            <p>What stood out to me the most was the ambience and the scenic open area. I visited this winery twice, once during the day and once at night and I can't decide wheather Schmidt Family vineyards is more beautiful by day or by night?  One can give you a checkmate argument for each side.</p>

            <p>The grounds are beautiful, the building built with great attention to detail, and the location is stunning. Inside the tasting room you have an amazing picture window to enjoy the view. There is ample seating available outside to sit in the sun and enjoy the view.</p>

            <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

            <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

            <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

            <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

            <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

            <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
